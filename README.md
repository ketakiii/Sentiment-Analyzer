# Sentiment-Analyzer
This detects the sentiments of a text. I have used the Amazon phone reviews dataset for this. 
 Check the code in a rendered format to understand how the code is written. I have implemented it in Jupyter notebook and hence the code is done step wise with several outputs. 
 
 The code has been explained with comments in the code itself.
