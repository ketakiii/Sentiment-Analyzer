# Sentiment-Analyzer
This detects the sentiments of a text. I have used the Amazon phone reviews dataset for this. 
The code gives us if the review is positive, negative or neutral. It also has analyzed and plotted the data in various forms.
 I have also uploaded the dataset I have used in a zip file here.
